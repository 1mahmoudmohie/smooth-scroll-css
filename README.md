# smooth-scroll-css
this is my first time learning how to make a smooth scroll using css, in this code i used a scroll snap type in the y-axis so as to if u were to be in a situation where u r scrolling down and happen to between two section and none of them is being visible fully, then this scroll snap type in css enables the scroll bar to snap to the closest section accordingly.
u can also use the arrow key to explore the site freely in the up and down directions you will notice with more freedom the smooth scrolling effect
i added a hamburger menu 
i added hover effects over menu items
